    text: "We're not often home and I needed a company I could trust to handle things without any micromanaging. These guys nailed it—pun intended. They kept me updated with texts, photos and even a drone video of the final inspection. Landed to a finished roof and zero stress. Couldn't ask for more.",

    title: '"But This Crew? Absolute Pros"',
    text: "I work from home, so I was nervous about all the noise and chaos of a roof replacement. But this crew? Absolute pros. They showed up right on time, worked like clockwork and even paused to explain what was going on when I peeked out with questions. Honestly, had to tell my routine Off—and they finished a day early. Who does that?",

    title: '"They Were Responsive, Respectful and Full of Good Energy"',
    text: "My deal with contractors before and let's just say... expectations were low. But this team company turned that around, from the first call to the final shingle, they were responsive, respectful and full of good energy. Even my grumpy neighbor came over to say how clean the place looked. My house has new style and honestly, I kinda miss having them around.",

    text: "I asked a lot of technical questions and honestly? I was impressed. The team had a streamlined process, online tools, digital contracts and real-time updates. They finished my modern home with care and even adjusted the ventilation based on smart sensor feedback. Who knew roofers could be this geeky — in a good way?",

    title: '"The Roof Looks Sharp"',
    text: "I've got animals, equipment and a whole lot of land—so when I hire someone, I need them to respect the space while they work. They were amazing. Parked where I asked, stayed out of the barn while they were here. Good people who care about more than just the job. The roof looks sharp and so does my peace of mind.",

    title: '"My Roof Looks Amazing"',
    text: "Running a small business and renovating a home at the same time is no joke, but this crew made the roofing part a breeze. They respected my time, worked around my hours and even helped pointing one morning after I mentioned I was stressed. They're a cut above—and I'll tell anyone who'll listen, professional and honest. We even gained an lunch date and techniques during the lunch break. My roof looks fabulous and I genuinely respect their work ethic.",
